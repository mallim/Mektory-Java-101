#Exercises

####Loops
1. Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 .. **n**. Where **n** is a number that you
input into your program. For example, inputing 5 should give me the answer to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.

2. The Taylor series function is approximated as e^x = 1 + x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! + ... Write a program
that calculates this value. (Try writing it in both the while and for loop variants)
