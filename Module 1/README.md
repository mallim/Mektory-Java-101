#Fahrenheit to Celcius
A pretty common need is to convert values from one unit to another but It's pretty time consuming to have to
do this by hand. Write a program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to celcius for you.

    T(°C) = (T(°F) - 32) × 5/9


#How long has it been since...
What time is it right now? Wonder how many seconds it's been since some other important time?
Write a program that calculates this for you. (Use the 24 hour clock for this - at 4pm the current time would be 16)

####Hints
Create variables `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds` and set these close to the current time. Calculate the difference from 00 00 00.
