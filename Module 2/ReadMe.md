#Exercises

###Math
1. Using the Math library (where applicable), calculate the real roots to the Quadratic equation Ax^2+Bx+C=0. 
(Hint: use the [quadratic formula](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/quadform.htm))

###Characters
1. Try printing "Hello World!" out to the console without using any character or string variables. (Hint: Take a look at the ascii table)

###If statement
1. Write a program to determine if a number is an even or an odd number. 
2. Write a program that allows the user to enter an age and outputs whether the user is old enough to drive. Sanitize your input by displaying an error if the user enters an invalid age (such as -1).
3. Sanitizing you input is important. This means making sure that what the user enters is something that you can actually use. When we used the `Math.sqrt(double a, double b)` in the first Math exercise problem. Sometimes it returns `NaN` (Not number). Use `if` statements to prevent this from happening. Display an error if the user enters numbers that could cause this to happen. Hint `Math.sqrt(double a, double b)` returns `NaN` if the result of its calculation is negative.
