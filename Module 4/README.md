#Arrays

1. Write a program that takes in a series of numbers from 1 .. 9. Your program should notify the user when they try
to enter invalid numbers (numbers that aren't between one and 10) and tell the user which numbers are missing. 
For example, entering 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 should return 8 as output. 

2. Write a program that sorts an array of random numbers. Entering 2, 5, 3, 7, 1, 6, 8, 10, 4 - should give
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as output.
