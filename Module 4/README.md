#Arrays

1. Write a program that finds the biggest number in a list. Given a list of [1, 3, 5, 12, 7, 9], your program should return 12. 

2. Write a program that sorts an array of random numbers. Entering 2, 5, 3, 7, 1, 6, 8, 10, 4 - should give
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 as output.

3. Write a program that takes in 9 numbers and stores them in an array of size 10. Each number should be between 1 and 10. Notify the user when they try
to enter invalid numbers (numbers that aren't between one and 10) and tell the user which numbers are missing. 
For example, entering 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 should return 8 as output. 

#Methods

1. Write a method `isContainsString` that takes two strings, `keyword` and `value` and returns a boolean. The method should return true if keyword is found in value. 
 
2. Write a method `letterGrade` that takes in a double representing a grade and returns a character that choresponds to the grade. For example a grade of 90 to 100 should return `'A'`, 80 to 89 should return a `'B'`...

3. Write a method that takes in a String in [Roman Numeral](http://literacy.kent.edu/Minigrants/Cinci/romanchart.htm) format and returns an int of the corresponding value. Forexample "XIII" should return the number 13.

4. Write a method `isPrime` that takes in a number and returns true if that number is a prime number.
